centos-scripts
==============

Usage:
------

bash setup.bash

How does it work?
----------------

Each installation kind has it own directory.
In each directory we must have:
- some bash scripts
- test.bash : this script will check if installation is well passed.

**Note**: directory name must have the same name as the installation kind.
